Functional pebbles is a set of classes intended to facilitate programming functional style 
in Java. Many of the classes copy functionality from similarly named classes in Scala, 
others are static functions that mimic built-in Scala functionality. Unlike in well 
known [vavr](https://www.vavr.io/) library _Functional Pebbles_ classes behave exactly as 
they do in Scala. They are:

1. `Try` (aka Error) monad.
2. Composable `TryFunction`
3. `Tuple` pair of values holding class.
4. `Collectionz` - additional utilities for collections.
